# Everything-From-Scratch-ML
Implementation of core Machine Learning algorithms from scratch using Python — no external ML libraries, just pure logic and math.

# Machine Learning From Scratch 🚀

This repository contains implementations of core **Machine Learning algorithms** built completely **from scratch** — no `scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`, or `PyTorch`.  
The goal is to deeply understand the mathematics and logic behind each model.
