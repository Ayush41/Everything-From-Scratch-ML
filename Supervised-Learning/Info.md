# 🧠 Supervised Learning

Welcome to the **Supervised Learning** section of the **Everything-From-Scratch-ML** repository!  
This folder focuses on implementing and understanding **Supervised Machine Learning algorithms** — from mathematical intuition to coding them **completely from scratch** (no scikit-learn shortcuts 🚫).

## 📘 What is Supervised Learning?

**Supervised Learning** is a type of machine learning where the model learns from **labeled data**.  
That means each training example includes **input features (X)** and a **target output (y)**.  
The goal is for the model to **learn a mapping function** from inputs → outputs, and make accurate predictions on unseen data.

Formally:
> Given a dataset D = {(x₁, y₁), (x₂, y₂), ..., (xₙ, yₙ)},  
> learn a function f(x) ≈ y.

## 🧩 Core Concepts

- **Training Data:** Data used to teach the model (contains inputs and outputs)
- **Testing Data:** Unseen data used to evaluate the model
- **Loss Function:** Measures how wrong the model’s predictions are
- **Optimization:** The process of minimizing the loss (e.g., using Gradient Descent)
- **Overfitting vs Underfitting:** Balancing model complexity and generalization

## 📊 Types of Supervised Learning

### 1. **Regression**
Predicting a **continuous numerical value**.
Examples:
- Predicting house prices
- Forecasting stock values
- Estimating temperature

Algorithms to be covered:
- Linear Regression  
- Polynomial Regression  
- Ridge & Lasso Regression  
- Support Vector Regression  

### 2. **Classification**
Predicting a **discrete category or label**.
Examples:
- Spam vs. Non-Spam emails  
- Disease detection (positive/negative)  
- Image recognition (cat/dog)
